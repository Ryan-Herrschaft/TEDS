# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS) tracks both admissions and discharges from substance use treatment facilities in the United States of America. Treatment facilities in Nebraska that receive public funds from the state substance abuse agency are required to submit information for the TEDS. 

We analyze TEDS data to look at differences in substances reported at admission in Nebraska between Metropolitan core-based statistical areas (CBSA) counties, Micropolitan CBSA counties, and counties that are Outside CBSA areas. Nebraska has four Metropolitan CBSAs: Omaha, Lincoln, Grand Island, and Sioux City. Micropolitan counties include towns such as: Kearney, Hastings, Norfolk, and Columbus. A full description of how Metro and Micro CBSA counties are defined is included in this report.  

In 2017, 52.61% of all admissions to treatment centers were in Metropolitan CBSAs (Omaha, Lincoln, Grand Island, Sioux City). The remainder of admissions were in Micropolitan or were Outside both Metro and Micro areas. Almost 30% of admissions were in areas Outside of Metro and Micro CBSA counties.

Metropolitan, Micropolitan, and Outside CBSA areas have different admission profiles for the substances that are listed at admission. This report looks at both how often a substance is listed in all admissions (the percent) and the rate of a substance being listed per 100,000 Nebraskans age 10 or older. 

When we look at the statewide and across state numbers there are a clear top three substances that are listed at admission for treatment: alcohol, marijuana, and methamphetamine. When looking at only primary substances at admission, these three substances are the primary substance in 87.55% of all admissions in Nebraska in 2017 (alcohol 56.32%, methamphetamine 21.51%, marijuana 9.72%).

Alcohol is listed more frequently in Metro and Outside CBSA areas than Micro areas. However, the rates of alcohol being listed per 100,000 Nebraskans age 10 or older are fairly similar between Metro and Micro areas, and much higher in Outside CBSA areas. Overall, alcohol is the most commonly listed substance at admission. 

Marijuana and Methamphetamine are more frequently listed in Micro areas by percent of admissions compared to Metro and Outside areas. However, when looking at rates of listing per 100,000 Nebraskans age 10 or older Micro and Outside areas are quite similar and the Metro rates are lower than both Micro and Outside CBSA areas.

Other substances are listed at admission, but none appear in more than 10% of admissions. The complete distribution and rate of these substances is provided in the full report.
