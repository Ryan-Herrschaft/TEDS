# Substance Use Treatment Profile of Nebraska

In this project, Patrick and I are seeking to understand how substance use patterns vary across the three Core Based Statitistical Areas in Nebraska.
This analysis will allow interested parties to better understand how substance use admissions from various susbtances are distributed across the state of Nebraska. With this knowledge, policy holders and other interested parties can more specifically allocate resources where there is the greatest need. 


## TEDS 
The first is a report summarizing and interpreting the findings regarding the admission episodes listed in the Treatment Episodes Data Set Nebraska 2017.


## Substance Use Treatment Capacity across Nebraska
The second deliverable of this project is a poster presentation analyzing the service offerings across Nebraskan CBSA's. The success and acceptability of substance use treatment to patients is strongly influenced by service delivery modality (inpatient, outpatient, residential, etc.). However, several factors of out of a patient’s control inhibit their ability to access treatment that is responsive to their desires and needs. Understanding the weaknesses of the current service provision modalities is essential to formulate targeted initiatives to improve substance use treatment quality in Nebraska. 

Using the federally maintained Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS), we examined how utilization of six modalities of substance use treatment varied across Nebraska’s metropolitan, micropolitan, and outside Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) in 2017. To provide context to our findings, we then analyzed the Behavioral Health Treatment Facility Listings Dataset (BHTFL) to provide a descriptive overview of treatment facilities across Nebraska’s CBSAs.

Our preliminary results depict a descriptive overview of how treatment capacity and services vary across the CBSA regions of Nebraska. Subsequent analyses will elucidate the role of structural and environmental factors in driving these differences.
