# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

In 2017, 52.61% of all admissions to treatment centers were in Metropolitan core-based statistical areas (Omaha, Lincoln, Grand Island, Sioux City). The remainder of admissions were in Micropolitan or were Outside both Metro and Micro areas. Almost 30% of admissions were in areas Outside of Metro and Micro areas.

Metropolitan, Micropolitan, and Outside CBSA areas have different admission profiles for the substances that are listed at admission. This report looks at both at how often a substance is listed in all admissions (the percent) and the rate of a substance being listed per 100,000 Nebraskans age 10 or older. 

Alcohol is listed more frequently in Metro and Outside CBSA areas than Micro areas. However, the rates of alcohol being listed per 100,000 Nebraskans age 10 or older are fairly similar between Metro and Micro areas and much higher in Outside CBSA areas. Overall, alcohol is the most commonly listed substance at admission. 

Marijuana and Methamphetamine are more frequently listed in Micro areas by percent compared to Metro and Outside areas. However, when looking at rates of listing per 100,000 Nebraskans age 10 or older Micro and Outside areas are quite similar and the Metro rates are lower than both Micro and Outside CBSA areas.

Other substances are listed at admission, but none appear in more than 10% of admissions. The full report on percent and rate of these substances is provided in the full report.

## Side Project: Substance Use Treatment Capacity across Nebraska
The second deliverable of this project is a poster presentation analyzing the service offerings across Nebraskan CBSA's. The success and acceptability of substance use treatment to patients is strongly influenced by service delivery modality (inpatient, outpatient, residential, etc.). However, several factors of out of a patient’s control inhibit their ability to access treatment that is responsive to their desires and needs. Understanding the weaknesses of the current service provision modalities is essential to formulate targeted initiatives to improve substance use treatment quality in Nebraska. 

Using the federally maintained Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS), we examined how utilization of six modalities of substance use treatment varied across Nebraska’s metropolitan, micropolitan, and outside Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) in 2017. To provide context to our findings, we then analyzed the Behavioral Health Treatment Facility Listings Dataset (BHTFL) to provide a descriptive overview of treatment facilities across Nebraska’s CBSAs.

Our preliminary results depict a descriptive overview of how treatment capacity and services vary across the CBSA regions of Nebraska. Subsequent analyses will elucidate the role of structural and environmental factors in driving these differences.
